# Advanced BMI Calculator

## Overview
The **Advanced BMI Calculator** is a web-based application that allows users to calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI) by entering their weight and height. The application also provides a real-time interpretation of the BMI category, such as Underweight, Normal weight, Overweight, or Obesity.

## Features
- **User-friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive design for seamless usage.
- **Real-time Calculation**: Automatically updates the BMI value and category as you input weight and height.

## How It Works
1. Enter your weight in kilograms (kg) in the `Weight` field.
2. Enter your height in centimeters (cm) in the `Height` field.
3. The BMI and its corresponding category will be displayed instantly.

## Formula Used
The BMI is calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{BMI} = \frac{\text{Weight (kg)}}{\text{Height (m)}^2} \]

Where height is converted from centimeters to meters before applying the formula.
